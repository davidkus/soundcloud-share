# Soundcloud Share [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidkus/soundcloud-share.svg?branch=improved-audio-sync)](https://travis-ci.org/davidkus/soundcloud-share)

Listen to Soundcloud tracks & playlists with your friends!

Built with Rails, React and Firebase.

Demo hosted on Heroku at [soundcloud-demo.kus.dk](http://soundcloud-demo.kus.dk)

## TODO

 - Better homepage (showing most shared public rooms?)
 - Advanced sharing (share with specific users)
 - Clean up guest users
 - Name Generator / Images for guest users (generated when the user is created)
 - Error handling if the owner disconnects
 - Look into writing unit tests for react components
